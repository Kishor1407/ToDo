# A BASIC TO-DO WEBAPP

Developed a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks.

You can visit the website at https://kishor-todo-list.netlify.app

This to-do web app allows users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list are visible. Also, a user can mark a
task “complete” upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks appears on a separate list, say Completed Tasks.

You can also add a separate section titled Pending Tasks that will list all the tasks that require completion. In such a case, the 
to-do list will be a union of the Pending Tasks list and the Completed Tasks list. Irrespective of the list, a user is able to delete 
or edit tasks from it.

To further increase the web app's complexity or make it more detailed, you can add the date and time when a task is added and/or completed.
